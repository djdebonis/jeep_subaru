## Analysis of value and value retention between 2008 Jeep Libertys and 2008 Subaru Outbacks

### Project Scope

During my first college statistics class, I decided to look at used-car sale values between two cars that still flood the streets of Denver: a 2008 Jeep Liberty, and a 2008 Subaru Outback. I originally wanted to look at earlier models (2002-2007), because those are actually a lot more common, but the website I used for the data collection (cargurus.com) didn't sell cars that old. So, I settled for the 2008s.

The initial project was a simple analysis of the means and standard deviations for used sales prices between the two cars. However, I decided to keep track of other information such as mileage because I thought it would be interesting to look at. I calculated some basic descriptive statistics (means, stds, etc.), ran a t-test or two, and put it on a poster to present for the class.

But then two years later, after I began to take interest in coding and data science, I decided to open the data back up and work with it on python. I spent a couple hours cleaning the data and opening it up on python, then met up with @mathematicalmichael and we spent all of a Saturday doing analysis and building matplotlib plots. The project has been a work-in-progress since then.
